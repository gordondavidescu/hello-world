a hello world repository

So this is my hello world repository. In here I am not only saying hello to the world but explaining a little about me, Gordon Davidescu. I grew up in New Jersey and was born in 1977, making me 37 as of this commit. I grew up on the Apple II GS and learned how to program in BASIC and then later Pascal. I fell out of love with programming when things did not go well with a data structures course at Rutgers. I am hoping that the online learning methods embodied in places like codecademy and code school will help me learn better than the structure of the Computer Science major at Rutgers.
